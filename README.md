# Career Guidance Expert System (Prolog)

## Overview
This is a small rule-based career suggestion system made using Prolog. Currently it is very a basic and not very accurate.
The program asks the user to choose one main interest and one skill, and based on simple predefined rules, it recommends a possible career.  
The goal was to learn basic Prolog concepts like facts, rules and simple decision logic. Learning fundamental Prolog ideas, such as facts, rules, and basic decision logic, was the aim. The system is compact and has the potential to grow in the future.

## Features
- User selects 1 interest
- User selects 1 skill
- System checks both in rule base
- Suggests a suitable career if rules match
- Shows “No suitable career found” if nothing matches
- Basic, beginner-friendly structure

## Technologies / Tools Used
- SWI-Prolog
- Simple text editor
- Command line interface

## Installation & Run Steps
1. Install SWI-Prolog on your computer
2. Create a project folder
3. Place these two files inside it:
   - `career.pl`
   - `main.pl`
4. Open SWI-Prolog
5. Load the project using:  [main].
6. Start the system with:  start.

## How To Test
- Select any interest number (example: `1.`)
- Select any skill number (example: `1.`)
- Check the printed output
- Try different combinations to see different results

## Screenshots (optional)

## Future Improvements
- adding more career paths
- more detailed questions
- adding score based system
- improving menu layout
