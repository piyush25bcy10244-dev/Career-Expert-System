# Problem Statement
Many students are confused about what career to choose, and normally they don't have enough guidance. The idea is to make a very basic program that can suggest a career based on a person's interest and skill. It is small scale and not a replacement of real counselling, but just a starting support tool.

# Scope of the Project
The system is limited and works only on a few interests and skills. It uses simple rule matching in Prolog to show one possible career path. The scope does not include deep analysis or real time data. In future it can be improved with more rules or better user interaction.

# Target Users
The target users are students who are unsure about career options, freshers exploring possible fields and also beginners learning Prolog and expert systems.

# High-Level Features
- ask the user for main interest
- ask the user for main skill
- match both to predefined rules
- suggest a possible career
- simple to use and can be updated later
